For this project, I will be building my own personal portfolio webpage to showcase my work to future job recruiters and when I am applying for new jobs!


I will be mainly building this in html and css then adding many javascript features as I continue to practice more javascript fundamentals and build more javascript projects. This project will contain two of my javascript projects and 4 other html/css projects in my portfolio. I hope to work on more javascript as I am working on this project. Exciting!

some features: 
-navigate to specifc section using the navigation bar at the top.
-project images enlarge when mouse is over it.
-links open in a new tab.
-text/background css effects
-grid layout/template
-simple css animation
-javascript features coming later.
